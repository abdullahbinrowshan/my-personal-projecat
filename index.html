            <h3>I am a beginner level Programmer and a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Needless to say, I come from a poor family, I am surrounded by the children of the rich. I thought I was also the son of a rich man, arrogance had come inside me. By the grace of Allah, after returning to Islam, I realized that I have to move forward, I have to take the helm. I will do something inshaAllah. But no one paid me for what I had done before. So I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become a web development hero inshaAllah.</p>
